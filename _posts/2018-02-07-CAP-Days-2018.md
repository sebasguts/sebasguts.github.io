[CAP (Categories, Algorithms, Programming)](http://homalg-project.github.io/CAP_project)
is a software project for constructive category theory written in GAP.
It facilitates both the realization of specific instances of categories
and the implementation of generic categorical algorithms.

The workshop aims at mathematicians who want to learn about the CAP project,
categorical programming, and structurizing implementations in a
categorical way.
The workshop is suitable for both GAP newcomers and veteran GAP programmers.

The workshop is split in three parts:

* Talks
* Tutorial
* Coding Sprint

Best regards,

Sebastian Gutsche & Sebastian Posur
