Here are some (randomly selected) projects I am currently working on or contributing to.
For a full overview, see my [GitHub page](https://github.com/sebasguts).

## [AutoDoc](https://gap-packages.github.io/AutoDoc/)

A tool that generates GAP documentation from
source code and doxygen style comments.

## [CAP project](https://homalg-project.github.io/CAP_project)

A GAP package for category theory.
It facilitates the implementation of specific instances of categories
and provides a language for writing generic categorical algorithms.
See [research](/research) for more details.

## [homalg project](https://homalg-project.github.io)

A GAP project for computations in homological algebra, consisting of
multiple packages along with interfaces to other CAS.

## [Jupyter kernel for Singular](https://github.com/sebasguts/jupyter_kernel_singular)

A python wrapper kernel for using the [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/) CAS
in Jupyter. It accesses Singular using Singulars callable library
and [PySingular](https://github.com/sebasguts/PySingular), a wrapper for some library
functions written in C++ for python 2 and 3.

## [Jupyter kernel for polymake](https://github.com/polymake/jupyter-polymake)

A python wrapper kernel for using the [polymake](https://polymake.org/doku.php) CAS
in Jupyter. It accesses polymake using polymakes callable and [JuPyMake](https://github.com/polymake/JuPyMake),
a wrapper for the necessary polymake callable library functions written in C++ for python 2 and 3.
The Jupyter kernel is shipped with polymake.

## [PyNormaliz](https://github.com/Normaliz/PyNormaliz)

Python 2/3 interface for the [Normaliz](https://www.normaliz.uni-osnabrueck.de/) library for
convex geometry. It provides full access to all functionality of the library, along with
more python-esque classes and wrappers for functions and output.
It is currently used in [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/index.html).

## [ThebeLab](https://github.com/minrk/thebelab)

A Javascript library to embed executable code examples into web pages.
