My research aims at designing and implementing a well-defined, consistent, and usable category theory language for computer algebra systems.

I am currently working on the [CAP project](https://homalg-project.github.io/CAP_project) and on the [OSCAR project](https://www.computeralgebra.de/oscar/).

Furthermore, I am the developer of the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) kernels for [polymake](https://polymake.org/doku.php) and [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/).

For a more detailed overview of (some of my) projects visit the [projects](/projects) page or see my [GitHub](https://github.com/sebasguts/) page.

## CAP project

[CAP (Categories, Algorithms, Programming)](http://homalg-project.github.io/CAP_project/)
is a software project
for constructive category theory
written in [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/).
It facilitates both the realization of
specific instances of categories
and the implementation of generic categorical algorithms.
With my colleague [Sebastian Posur](https://sebastianpos.github.io)
I gave an [introduction](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~daniel.juteau/juteau_files/slides.pdf)
at the Universit√© Paris Diderot
to constructive category theory and its applications to homological algebra.

## OSCAR project

The [OSCAR project](https://www.computeralgebra.de/oscar/) is meant to be the next generation
computer algebra system, combining the power of the four computer algebra systems [GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/),
[Nemo](http://nemocas.org/), [polymake](https://polymake.org/doku.php), and [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/)
by providing unlimited and full-speed access from and to those systems from [julia](https://julialang.org/).
It will furthermore provide data structures and algorithms itself that combine functionaliy from
all four systems.
